# PyBer_Analysis
# Overview
The point of this analysis is to go through ride sharing and city data to create a summary DataFrame of both the ride sharing and city data, and using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Pandas to create graphs. To impress the boss. The following will allow V.Isualize to compare mulitple city types and the total number of rides, drivers, fares, average fare per drivers, and average fare per rides.

# Results
When you look at the average fare per ride in section then you would see that the Rural area has the highest average. Which does make sense becase rural areas tend to be far away from each other. If you keep looking at the Rural area you would see that the total fares is lower than the other city types. I think that is the case sense most people in rural areas tend to have what they want at their homes. Since, as I said there are miles in between gas stations, schools, restaurants, and etc.
